# Face_Mask_Detector

This project is done in two parts. In the first part I utilized the functionality
of Keras and OpenCV to combine the combination of pre-built face detection
models using OpenCV and then use a mask/non-mask classification, using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The notebook to this approach is available 
[here](https://github.com/amir2520/Face_Mask_Detector/blob/main/Keras_face_mask_detection.ipynb)
