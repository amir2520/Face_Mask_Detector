# Face_Mask_Detector

This project is done in two parts. In the first part I utilized the functionality
of Keras and OpenCV to combine the combination of pre-built face detection
models using OpenCV and then use a mask/non-mask classification, using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The notebook to this approach is available 
[here](https://github.com/amir2520/Face_Mask_Detector/blob/main/Keras_face_mask_detection.ipynb)

In the second part of this project, I used the power of TensorFlow Object Detection API
to train my own customized Face Mask Classifier, using around 170 images of
people either wearing face mask or not and then labeling them.
You can check the notebook of the end result [here](https://github.com/amir2520/Face_Mask_Detector/blob/main/workspace/training_demo/test_model2.ipynb) and 
the report file is available [here](https://github.com/amir2520/Face_Mask_Detector/blob/main/Face_Mask_Detector_report.pdf)
